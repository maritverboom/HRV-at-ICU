HRV analysis
Created: 10/2021 - 02/2022
Python v3.8
Author: M. Verboom

Basic algorithm for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. This script was 
written during a Technical Medicine year 2 internship (TM2). The purpose of the
algorithm is to analyze the HRV of ICU patients. Further improvements include:
    - Adding timestamps to the outputfile in order to be able to analyze
      circadian rhythms
    - Improving artefact detection

Make sure the following files are stored in the same folder before running:
    - HRV_main.py
    - HRV_preprocessing.py
    - HRV_calculations.py
    - HRV_batchmode.py
    - files_id.txt
    
Output variables: 
    - batch_df: list containing dataframes with timestamps, raw- and filtered
      ECG signals per included patient
    - batch_nni: list containing arrays with nni per included patient [ms]
    - batch_nni_first: list containing arrays with nni per included patient 
      [ms], before ectopic beat- and outlier removal
    - batch_rpeaks: list containing arrays with rpeak locations [s]
    - batch_rpeaks_first: list containing array with rpeak locations [s]-
      before ectopic beat- and outlier removal

Output file: the output file is stored in the same folder as the current file.
    - HRVparameters.csv: file containing all calculated HRV parameters per 
      included patient for the first hour of ECG recording. Rows = patients,
      columns = HRV parameters
    - per5min.csv: file containing mean calculcated HRV parameters per 5-minute
      segment per included patient for the first hour of ECG recording. Rows =
      patients, columns = HRV parameters
